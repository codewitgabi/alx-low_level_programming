## Project Description
This project covers C variables, if, else, for and while loops. I will be giving some alternative to some questions and also describing certain complex syntaxes.

### 8-print_base16.c
when used with a standard library, the code snippet below can be used.

```
int i;

for (i = 0; i < 16; i++)
	printf("%.1x", i);
```

`%x` is the format specifier for hex value. `%.1x` gives only 1 byte of the hex value.
