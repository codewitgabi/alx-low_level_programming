## Project Description
This project covers the concept of arrays, pointers and strings in the C programming language. The various ways that pointers can be used in a C program is further broken down into various files as will be listed below.

### 0-reset_to_98.c
In this file, a function is written that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### 1-swap.c
A function is written to swap the value of two integers.

### 2-strlen.c
A function is written to find the length of a string rather than using the builtin strlen() function.

### 3-puts.c
A function is written that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. This string is outputted using the _putchar() function in _putchar.c

### 4-print_rev.c
A function is written that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line using the _putchar() function.

### 5-rev_string.c
A function is written that reverses a given string.

### 6-puts2.c
A function is written that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. In other words, print string at odd indexes.

### 7-puts_half.c
A function is written that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. The function prints the second half of the string.

### 8-print_array.c
A function is written that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line using _putchar() function.
* Numbers are separated by comma, followed by a space
* The numbers are displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
* printf() is user in this file

### 9-strcpy.c
A function is written that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
* Return value for the function is the pointer to dest.
